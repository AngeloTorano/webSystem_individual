INDIVIDUAL ASSIGNMENT: 
	Code Organization with PHP Include and Form Validation Using Regular Expression

Objective: 
	The purpose of this assignment is to learn how to organize code efficiently by
	dividing it into modular sections using PHP's include function. This practice will help make your
	code cleaner, easier to manage, and more scalable.

Instructions:

1. Prepare Your Past Lab Exercise:
   
	o Start by selecting one of your previous laboratory exercises, preferably one with
	multiple sections (e.g., header, footer, navigation, and main content).

	o Open this file and identify the distinct sections within it.

2. Convert to PHP and Divide into Sections:
   
	o Save your entire HTML file as a PHP file.

	o Separate each identified section (such as header, footer, navigation, and main
	content) into individual PHP files.

	o Name each file according to the section it contains (e.g., header, footer, etc.).

3. Integrate with Include:
   
	o Create a main PHP file (e.g., index.php).

	o In this main file, use the PHP include function to add each of the section files you
	created. Each section should be represented in the main file only as an include
	statement, which will import the code for that section.

4. Converting Login and Register Pages from HTML to PHP:
   
	o Change the file names of login.html and register.html to login.php and
	register.php.

	o Use PHP validation and regular expressions.

5. Test and Verify:
    
	o Run the main file on a local PHP server environment (e.g., XAMPP or WAMP).

	o Confirm that all sections are loaded correctly and that your web page displays as
	expected.

	o Ensure the code remains functional and that each section is correctly linked.

6. Submission Requirements:
    
	o Submit all your PHP files, with each section file correctly named.

	o Include a screenshot of the code and output or a PDF of the rendered page,
		showing that each section has been included successfully.

Expected Outcome: 
	By completing this assignment, you should have a fully functional
	webpage structured using PHP include, with each section in its own file. This modular approach
	will make your code easier to read, maintain, and update in the future.
